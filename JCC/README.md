## Caesar Cipher
Is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
<br/>
It is a type of **substitution cipher** in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
<br/><br/>
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
<br/><br/>
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
